The project introduces a broad and general optimization framework on Home Energy Management 
System (HEMS). The twenty-first century is now an age in which everything operates primarily 
on electricity. In recent pandemic circumstances, the routine saw higher electricity consumption. 
A predictive model sets out the steps to keep track of whether excess electricity is being used. The 
Home Energy Management System is used to estimate the power consumption of the home at the 
device level. Within the web application, users can find predicted data. For this a unique key 
generated for login credentials which give login access requests. In different stages of 
preprocessing data, all backend processing will be performed by splitting into training with the
existing dataset. Further, the testing with real-time data is integrated with an algorithm (RNNLSTM) which would provide estimated results that suit for better understanding in the analysis of 
graphs and table values. With a smaller degree of granularity for the household level, all the 
predicted values will be more effective, because more integrated data would be handled and the 
predicted values would be much better. The LSTM algorithm has been used for data size 
processing since initially, data will be a weekly and monthly record
